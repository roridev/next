# alice's flully idealism zone~

This is a repository about ideas~.  
Stuff written here may manifest as actual projects in the future, but nothing is guaranteed.  
Everything here is **not** set in stone, if you have something to contribute **please do.** Defining stuff that may never happen is more fun with friends after all~.  

## Why `next`?

Ideas that I'll eventually work on once they're fully developed. As in the `next` things [*to be done* - burning ideas of a lazy developer](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/).  

## How to help

### **If you're trying to change some API details that are specific to a single project (when they become repos) do that on their respective repos.**

If you have fleshed out something [`open a PR`](https://github.com/roridev/next/compare) with your proposed changes.  
If they're good i'll **press the button** and they'll be added here.  
If they aren't i'll **press the other button** and they won't.  


If you have some random idea that you think its beneficial just [open an issue](https://github.com/roridev/next/issues/new).
