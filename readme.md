# alice's flully idealism zone~

This is a repository about ideas~.  
Stuff written here may manifest as actual projects in the future, but nothing is guaranteed.  
Everything here is **not** set in stone, if you have something to contribute **please do.** Defining stuff that may never happen is more fun with friends after all~.  

## Why `next`?

Ideas that I'll eventually work on once they're fully developed. As in the `next` things [*to be done* - burning ideas of a lazy developer](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/).
